Info/Location: 
Only I submitted. Class account dir: '/Assignment1/'. All files are zipped 
into Assignment1.zip due to the nature of the single file submission on gsubmit.
I had too many library files.

Run make to compile. Run ./as1 <params>

---------------------
*Ward Anisotropic
	The command line options are:	-kw r g b 
									-kwv x y z
									-kwc ax ay
	The r g b values are the reflective coefficients between 0 and 1 inclusive. 
	x y z is the arbitrary vector used to generate the spread directions. 
	ax ay are the spread coefficients between (0, 1].

	ex.
	./as1 -pl 200 200 200 0.2 0.2 0.9 -kd 1 1 1 -ka 0.1 0.1 0 -kw 1.0 0.2 0.4 -kwv 1 0 1 -kwc 0.2 0.4

	NOTE: PLEASE NO ZERO-VECTORS (x y z), OR 0 COEFICIENTS (ax, ay). IT WILL CRASH!!! :(

*Multi-Spheres
	The command line option is: -multi

	Simply add the parameter -multi and it will draw much balls.

	ex.
	./as1 -pl 200 200 200 0.6 0.6 0.6 -kd 1 1 0 -ka 0.1 0.1 0 -ks 0.8 0.8 0.8 -sp 16 -multi

*Draw Wave
	The command line option is: -wave

	Simply add the parameter -wave and it will draw a sin * cos wave.

	ex.
	./as1 -pl 200 200 200 0.6 0.6 0.6 -kd 1 1 0 -ka 0.1 0.1 0 -ks 0.8 0.8 0.8 -sp 16 -wave

	NOTE: I wanted a cloth looking surface but it didn't come out exactly the way I 
			wanted it to. I have a feeling it might be an issue with the normal
			calculation of a surface. Or that the surface has no "thickness".
