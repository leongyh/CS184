Platform: 
Unix/Ubuntu 14.01


Info/Location: 
Only I submitted. Class account dir: '/Assignment2/'. All files are zipped 
into Assignment1.zip due to the nature of the single file submission on gsubmit.
I had too many library files.


Libraries Included: 
GLM
pugixml
lodePNG


Instructions: 
Run make to compile. Run ./as2 <params>

<params> are as follows:
-f <file input dir>
-dim <image width> <image height>
-img <image file out dir>
-d <recursion depth; 5 default>

IMPORTANT:
Inthe the input file, under the obj input, the 2nd parameter is an optional int based on the format of the input file given. Default value is 1. Formats are:

0 			%d %d %d
1 			%d//%d %d//%d %d//%d

Extra Credit:
---------------------
Simple XML Reader:
I built a XML reader using the pugixml library, before I realized that we had a specified input file. I found XML to be more nicely formatted that allowed material coefficients and transformations to be applied specifically to an object. Doesn't work importing obj files though.
